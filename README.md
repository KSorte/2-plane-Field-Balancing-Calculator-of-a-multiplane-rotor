# 2-plane-Field-Balancing-Calculator-of-a-multiplane-rotor
1)The program works based on the method created by Rathbone and Thearle to balance rotors with a programmable calculator saving several hours of work when compared 
with graphical or other methods. 

2)The program takes in values of initial vibrations at bearings, the vibrations resulting from the trial runs, the known imbalances introduced in the trial runs and 
calculates correction masses required and at what angle on each rotor using Symbolic Math toolbox in Matlab.
